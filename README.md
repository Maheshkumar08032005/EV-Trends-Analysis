# Electric Vehicle Trends and Sustainability Metrics (2017â€“Present)

This project is a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle rebate trends based on the **NYSERDA Drive Clean Rebate Dataset** from 2017 to the present. Developed as part of my **INT375 Project** during the B.Tech CSE program at **Lovely Professional University**, this study focuses on understanding how rebate programs influence EV adoption patterns, popular vehicle models, environmental impact, and regional uptake in New York State.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to draw insights from a real-world government dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, and visualize those insights in a way that supports sustainable decision-making and policy development.

The key aspects analyzed include:

- Rebate distribution trends  
- Most popular EV models  
- County-wise rebate distribution  
- Rebate amount patterns  
- Environmental impact (GHG and petroleum reductions)  
- Distribution of rebate amounts by EV type

##  Exploratory Analysis Objectives

### Objective 1: Understand Year-wise Rebate Trends

Analyzed the distribution of EV rebates from 2017 to the present. A line plot revealed the growth trend of electric vehicle adoption, with fluctuations highlighting policy and market influences.

### Objective 2: Identify the Most Popular EV Models for Rebates

Using a bar plot, the top EV models were visualized based on the number of rebates issued. Tesla Model 3 emerged as the leading vehicle, followed by Chevrolet Bolt and Nissan Leaf.

### Objective 3: Understand the Distribution of Rebate Amounts

A KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plot was used to show the distribution of rebate amounts. Most rebates clustered around standard state rebate amounts, with a few outliers indicating possible special program conditions.

### Objective 4: Identify the Top 10 Counties with the Most EV Rebates

Horizontal bar plot visualizing the top 10 counties in New York by rebate count. This revealed that urban counties like Kings, Nassau, and Suffolk showed strong adoption patterns.

### Objective 5: Analyze Rebate Amounts Across Different EV Types

A violin plot was used to compare how rebate amounts varied across EV types (e.g., Battery Electric, Plug-in Hybrid). The spread and density offered deeper insights into rebate policy fairness and alignment with vehicle category.

##  Conclusion

This project highlights the practical impact of EV rebate programs on clean energy adoption. While rebates moderately correlate with environmental benefits, strong interdependence exists between GHG and petroleum reductions. Data visualizations effectively decoded adoption trends, consumer preferences, and rebate-driven behavior across New York counties. The NYSERDA dataset proved invaluable in showcasing how state-driven incentives play a pivotal role in EV growth.

##  Future Scope

- Integrate demographic and income-level data to analyze rebate accessibility  
- Expand to include datasets from multiple states for a comparative study  
- Use machine learning models to predict rebate efficiency and EV adoption likelihood  
- Analyze before/after impacts of major policy changes to assess effectiveness
